It is shown that for each numberN and Turing machineQ there exists a HamiltonianHNQ and a class of appropriate initial states such that if c is such an initial state, thenpsQN(t)=exp(-1HNQt)psQN(0) correctly describes at timest3,t6,[?],t3N model states that correspond to the completion of the first, second, [?], Nth computation step ofQ. The model parameters can be adjusted so that for an arbitrary time intervalD aroundt3,t6,[?],t3N, the "machine" part ofpsQN(t) is stationary.},

That said, it's far from clear what technology practical quantum computers -- if and when they arrive -- will use. In an extensive review, six researchers from major labs in the field describe the latest work on the hardware for quantum information systems. Current materials are compared -- including the nuclear spins of donor atoms in doped silicon, electron spins in gallium arsenide and nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamond -- and the materials that are yet to come are speculated upon.},
